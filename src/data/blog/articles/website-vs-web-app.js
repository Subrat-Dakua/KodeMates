        <p>While both technologies run inside web browsers and render HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, their architectural intent is entirely divergent:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Content Website:</strong> Designed to inform, persuade, and educate visitors. The dominant data flow is unidirectional (server to reader), with minimal mutations beyond form submissions or email captures.</li>
          <li><strong>Web Application:</strong> Designed to process workflows, manage state, enforce complex access boundaries, and transform data. The user interaction is continuous, bi-directional, and stateful.</li>

        <p>In modern digital ecosystems, successful software businesses rarely pick one in total isolation. The recommended architecture separates marketing touchpoints from authenticated application shells:</p>
        <p>Host marketing documentation and blog insights on a high-speed, edge-cached static or SSR system (such as KodMates web properties), while mounting authenticated operations at <code>app.yourdomain.com</code>.</p>
